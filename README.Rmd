<!-- GITHUB ACTIONS badges: start

Replace `mygithubuser` with your Github user name, and mypackage with the repository name.
This badge is populated by the Github action `.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml` which will be triggered on push to the branch `main`.

[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/mygithubuser/mypackage/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mygithubuser/mypackage/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml)

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: This is a TEMPLATE repository**
>
> This README.Rmd explains how the template works. When you use this for your own package, **replace this entire file** with documentation specific to your package.

## What is blankpkg_template?

**A production-ready R package template with comprehensive development infrastructure.**

This template provides:

- **30 development functions** organized by workflow category
- **Automatic pre-commit hooks** for code quality
- **4-step CRAN release workflow**
- **pkgdown website configuration** with example article
- **Rcpp/C++ integration support**
- **Claude Code AI agents** for documentation review and CRAN compliance
- **Comprehensive testing and checking tools**

**Design philosophy:** Make package development as fast and friction-free as possible.

## Quick Start

1. **Use this template** on GitHub to create your repository
2. **Install development tools:**
   ```r
   setup_install_tools()
   ```
3. **Customize** DESCRIPTION and replace this README
4. **Learn the workflow:** Read [TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md) for complete guide

## Documentation Map

Your comprehensive guide to all template resources:

| Resource | Purpose | When to Use |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **[TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md)** | Complete step-by-step guide (2200+ lines) | First-time setup, learning workflows, troubleshooting |
| **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** | Claude Code AI integration guide | Using AI agents, coding style, project conventions |
| **[.Rprofile](.Rprofile)** | Auto-loading configuration | Understanding function availability on startup |
| **[dev/](dev/)** | Development functions | Full development workflow |

## Key Features

### Development Functions

Functions organized by **prefix-based naming** for autocomplete discovery:

- **`setup_*`** - Initial package configuration, Rcpp support
- **`dev_*`** - Daily development workflows (load, quick check, complete check)
- **`test_*`** - Testing, coverage reporting, spell checking
- **`release_*`** - 4-step CRAN submission workflow
- **`build_*`** - README and vignette generation
- **`help_*`** - Interactive guides and installation help
- **`report_*` / `template_*`** - Code analysis and development templates

**See [TUTORIAL.md#development-scripts-reference](TUTORIAL.md#development-scripts-reference) for complete function descriptions.**

### Pre-Commit Hook System

Automatically runs before each commit:

1. **jarl lint --fix** - Auto-fix linting issues (if installed)
2. **air format** - Code formatting (if installed)
3. **devtools::document()** - Update documentation (required)
4. **devtools::check()** - CRAN-level checks (required)

Skip for quick commits: `git commit --no-verify -m "WIP"`

**See [TUTORIAL.md#pre-commit-hook-system](TUTORIAL.md#pre-commit-hook-system) for details.**

### Claude Code AI Agents

Specialized agents in `.claude/` folder:

- **roxygen-doc-reviewer** - Reviews roxygen2 documentation for completeness, accuracy, and clarity
- **cran-submission-expert** - Assists with CRAN preparation and policy compliance

**See [TUTORIAL.md#claude-code-ai-agents](TUTORIAL.md#claude-code-ai-agents) for usage examples.**

## Acknowledgements

This template would have been impossible without the outstanding effort of the R community and the developers of the following excellent packages:

- **devtools** (Wickham et al., 2025) - Tools to make developing R packages easier. The backbone of modern R package development. https://devtools.r-lib.org/

- **usethis** (Wickham et al., 2025) - Automates package and project setup tasks, making package infrastructure setup painless. https://usethis.r-lib.org

- **testthat** (Wickham, 2011) - Unit testing framework that makes testing R packages straightforward and enjoyable. https://testthat.r-lib.org/

- **covr** (Hester, 2023) - Test coverage analysis to identify untested code and improve package quality. https://covr.r-lib.org/

- **spelling** (Ooms & Hester, 2025) - Spell checking tools that catch typos in documentation before they reach users. https://docs.ropensci.org/spelling/

- **goodpractice** - Package quality analyzer that provides actionable recommendations for improving R packages.

- **rhub** (Csárdi & Salmon, 2025) - Multi-platform package checking infrastructure for validating packages across different systems. https://r-hub.github.io/rhub/
